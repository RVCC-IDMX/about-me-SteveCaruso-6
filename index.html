            <h2>Some Literary Work</h2>

                <p>"Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us." She was looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with
                    fervour. I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of
                    that ruddy vampire sleep.</p>

                <p>And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends--and him--whom
                    Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us. 6 November.--It was late in the afternoon
                    when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not
                    go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we
                    dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take
                    some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see
                    through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I
                    was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear
                    line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the
                    angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
                    perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between
                    it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about
                    the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even
                    though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr.
                    Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be
                    less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the
                    drifted snow.</p>

                <p>In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful
                    spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He
                    took me by the hand and drew me in: "See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves
                    do come I can meet them one by one." He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got
                    out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive
                    to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He
                    looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the
                    top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--</p>

                <p>"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!" I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his
                    glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high
                    wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow
                    flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a
                    great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a
                    black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off--in
                    fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a group of mounted men hurrying along.
                    In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's
                    tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I
                    could see from the men's clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.</p>

                <p>On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was
                    coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till
                    then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In
                    fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I
                    saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night.
                    When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--</p>

                <p>"At least you shall be safe here from him!" He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the
                    snow swept the whole space below us. "See," he said, "they come quickly; they are flogging the
                    horses, and galloping as hard as they can." He paused and went on in a hollow voice:--</p>
